# Part 3: Where to go From Here

You've now been introduced to the world of neural networks, there is so much more to learn about though!

There are several directions you could go from here, here are just a few

* Apply a neural network to another dataset
* Learn about the theory behind neural networks
  * I recommend Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning Course on Coursera](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), you can watch the lectures for free
* Learn about other types of neural networks. i.e. Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, etc.
