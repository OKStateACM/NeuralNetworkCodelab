# Neural Networks Codelab

In this codelab, we're going to be exploring the exciting world of Neural Networks!

This codelab is going to be split into two parts

* What is a Neural Network?
  * This one will be kinda lectury and boring, but will all make sense later!
* Implementing a Neural Network
  * Fun Stuff!

## Stuff to do now
* Install python if you haven't already
